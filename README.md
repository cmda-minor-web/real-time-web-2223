# Concept

My concept is that when you're in the chatroom, you can look together through the cocktails and chat about them. This serves as a cocktail menu and everyone can look through the cocktail at the same time.

I actually wanted to make a drinking game, but since I wasn't able to finish all functionalities in time, I decided that I'll keep it on the menu.

## Functionalities

What I finished:

- add username
- add api
- being able to go look at the same cocktails as others
- seeing how many people are online
- have the game starting when there are at least 2 players

What I haven't been able to finish:

- add a spinner for the drinking game
- have a certain player be to only one who can spin at a time
- have other users see the spinner at the same time
